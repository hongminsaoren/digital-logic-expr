# FPGA Lab Experiments

This repository contains the source code and simulation files for a series of FPGA design labs conducted using Vivado and the Xilinx A7-100T development boards. These experiments cover various digital design topics including arithmetic logic units, multipliers, dividers, VGA interfaces, memory modules, and CPU design.

## Experiments Included:
-  Design of adders, shifters, and comparators.
-  Implementation of multipliers and dividers.
-  VGA display interfacing for image and character display.
-  Design and simulation of memory types on FPGA.
-  Construction of a single-cycle CPU for basic operations.
-  etc.
## Tools:
- **Vivado Design Suite**: For all design, synthesis, and simulation needs.
- **Xilinx A7-100T**: FPGA development board used in all experiments.

## Usage:
Clone this repository, navigate to each lab's directory, and follow the instructions provided for setup and execution in Vivado.
